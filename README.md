# Centripeta

This is a set of tools for controlling the centripeta robots. 

## Installation

The easiest way to install centripeta is using pip:

<!-- I will pin the install to a particular release once we are ready to publish-->

## Examples

Example protocols can be found below...

<!--Liwei, I think it would be good to have some code examples here in the README as well as in the protocols folder-->
